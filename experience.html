            <h3>C# Backend Developer Intern</h3>
            <h4>Envestnet | MoneyGuide</h4>
            <p>I worked collaboratively in an Agile setting alongside a team of other interns to design and develop two
                full-stack
                financial analysis applications. One was an opportunity cost calculator for paying student loans off
                quickly versus
                paying over time and investing the difference. The other was a tool for analyzing costs associated with
                having
                dependents with special needs, which will be continued as a new feature of the product.

                I learned to use Jira and Bitbucket (Git) in a production environment to build C# .NET APIs. Designed
                and developed APIs
                with C# .NET and document based databases in MongoDB and PostgreSQL through independent research and
                discourse with
                colleagues. Received 1-on-1 mentorship with a dedicated mentor.

                I also engaged in code reviews with developers. Learned design patterns and code composition, and
                implemented them into
                my application's design. Actively asked questions and sought feedback from peers and mentors.I worked
