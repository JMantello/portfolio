## Introduction:

The goal of this project is to demonstrate that we have the necessary foundational understanding of HTML and CSS by building a static portfolio site and deploying it.

## Project requirements:

The project will include four main pages:

### Home Page

This landing page is your first impression. You can include a photo, a mission statement, and something which defines you. Using a quote is a great idea, as well.

### Bio Page

Your bio page is a place for people to get to know you. You should include your interests, things you are good at, and in general you should pull back enough of the curtain into your life to interest a potential employer in you as a person.

### Experience Page

This should highlight your past experience, both professionally and academically.  Include employers/schools as you might on a resume, and list accomplishments at each organization.

### Portfolio Page

The meat and potatoes of your personal site, here you want to include the projects you've worked on. For each project you wish to showcase, you should include the name of your project, a brief description, a screenshot, and a link to where it lives on the web.  Since we donâ€™t have any projects to display yet, placeholder images/links/descriptions are completely fine.

## Conclusions:

Before this project, I had taken a class on HTML and CSS, so I did have some knowledge coming in. I wanted to focus on the fundamentals of organizing the HTML and CSS code efficiently, using selectors and ids properly, learning flex-box more in depth, accounting for accessability, and making the page visually appealing. Along the way, I found a YouTube channel called "Hyperplexed" and I found his content really eye-opening to what can really be done with HTML, CSS, and JS. It's pretty cool, and I feel like I am much more interested in front-end development than I was before.
